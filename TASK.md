# Zellij Visual Integration

Now hear me out...
I LOVE this notification. It works really really well.
But I want to explore a new possibility -

## Goal

For every notification, i would like a visual cue to accompany it.

## Requirements

1. The visual cue should be associated with the Zellij tab in your active session that the notification was meant for.
2. The notification should remain visible until acknowledged by visiting the tab by making it active
3. The notification should include periodic movement (a bounce, spin, arrow, etc) to draw attention every 30 seconds.
